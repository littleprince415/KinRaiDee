VS Code : If you have 'live server' extension, you can go to 'index.html' and right click > 'Open With Live Server' 
        : If you don't have live sever extension, open internet browser (such as Google Chrome or FireFox etc. ) and type 'http://localhost:(yourport)/' in search bar.
        example my port is 5500 I will type 'http://localhost:5500/' in my internet browser search bar. 

In app function : 1. Randomize your food by clicking a 'Random' button, the result will show in form bar.
                  2. Add your meal list by typing the meal word into the form and then press the 'add' button, 
                  you can also delete data by clicking 'delete'.


Note : I'm so sorry for the lack of web decoration. Due to the three day period I received, 
I have to take a two-day final exam and prepare to present my web application project. 
So I might not be able to make the css, organize my code and do other bonuses in time..
